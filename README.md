# Diabetes Predictor in India

Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/diabetes-prediction-in-india-dataset/data

## Technologies Used:
* Python (main programming language)
* NumPy (mathematials and array processing)
* Pandas (used for reading csv and json files)
* Seaborn (library used to visualize findings in the form of histograms, scatterplots, etc)
* Matplotlib (basic library for plotting)
* scikit-learn (primary library used to train the machine learning models)
* MySQL (primary database software used to implement a dynamic dataset)

## Technologies Not Used Yet:
* Apache (primary web server)

## Algorithms Used:
* K-Means Clustering (identify similarity of people in the dataset, probably relevant to the goal)
* Linear Regression and Polynomial Features (
* Logistic Regression (Simple Yes or No to determine whether people have diabetes or not)

# Phases:
1. K-Means Clustering Model for grouping similar people in the dataset and how likely they are to have diabetes
2. Regression Models for identifying trends in dataset columns
3. Webapp and
